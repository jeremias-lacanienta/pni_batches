# PostgreSQL Database "prod" - Comprehensive Schema Analysis & Critical Assessment

**Database:** prod  
**Analysis Date:** August 30, 2025  
**Total Schemas:** 3 (`lesson_planner_fe`, `practise_improve_pilot`, `public`)  
**Total Tables:** 25  
**Total Data Rows:** 637  

---

## Executive Summary

The "prod" database contains two active application schemas serving different educational platforms:
- **`lesson_planner_fe`**: A lesson planning frontend application (10 tables, 499 rows)
- **`practise_improve_pilot`**: An English language learning platform (15 tables, 138 rows)
- **`public`**: Empty schema (should be cleaned up)

### Critical Health Metrics
- **Data Quality Issues:** 游댮 Multiple tables with empty required fields
- **Performance Issues:** 游리 High dead tuple ratios in several tables
- **Schema Design Issues:** 游댮 Several critical design flaws identified
- **Security Posture:** 游리 Adequate but needs improvements

---

## Detailed Schema Analysis

### 1. Schema: `lesson_planner_fe` - Lesson Planning Application

**Purpose**: Frontend application for educational lesson planning and management

#### Core Entity Relationships:
```
School (1) --> (*) Teacher (1) --> (*) Class
Teacher (1) --> (*) Lesson_Plan --> (*) Lesson_Plan_Instance
Lesson_Plan_Instance (1) --> (*) Feedback
Lesson_Plan_Instance (1) --> (1) Reflection
Subject (1) --> (*) Topic (1) --> (*) Lesson
```

#### Critical Issues Found:

**游댮 Data Integrity Problems:**
1. **Duplicate Column Definitions**: The `feedback` table shows duplicate columns, indicating potential schema corruption or view definition issues
2. **Missing Foreign Key Constraints**: No explicit foreign key relationships defined between core entities
3. **Soft Delete Implementation**: Using `deleted_at` timestamps but no constraints to ensure data consistency

**游리 Data Quality Issues:**
- `feedback.comment`: 7 empty strings (38.9% of records)
- `reflection` table: Multiple fields with 100% empty strings indicating poor user adoption or UX issues

**游리 Performance Concerns:**
- Multiple tables with high dead tuple ratios (25-50%)
- No partitioning strategy for potentially growing tables
- Extensive indexing may be over-engineered for current data volume

#### Design Strengths:
- Consistent UUID usage for primary keys
- Proper timestamp tracking (`created_at`, `updated_at`)
- JSONB usage for flexible content storage
- Comprehensive indexing strategy

### 2. Schema: `practise_improve_pilot` - Language Learning Platform

**Purpose**: English language learning platform with AI-generated content and user progress tracking

#### Core Entity Relationships:
```
Users (1) --> (*) Lesson_Progress
Users (1) --> (*) Answers --> (1) Feedback
Lessons (1) --> (*) Passages --> (*) Questions
Prompt_Groups (1) --> (*) Prompts
Users (1) --> (*) Chat_Conversations --> (*) Chat_Messages
```

#### Critical Schema Flaws:

**游댮 Major Design Issues:**

1. **Inconsistent ID Strategy**:
   - Mix of UUIDs and integers for primary keys
   - `lessons.id` is integer but `lesson_progress.lesson_id` expects UUID
   - **IMPACT**: This will cause application failures and data corruption

2. **Missing Primary Key**:
   - `lessons_backup` table has no primary key
   - **IMPACT**: Replication issues, poor performance, potential data loss

3. **Type Inconsistency**:
   - `progress.user_id` is `varchar(100)` while `users.id` is UUID
   - **IMPACT**: Foreign key relationships cannot be established properly

4. **Orphaned Tables**:
   - Multiple tables are completely empty despite being in production
   - Tables like `answers`, `chat_conversations`, `feedback` suggest features not in use
   - **IMPACT**: Unnecessary complexity and maintenance overhead

**游댮 Data Quality Problems:**
- `lessons.topic`: 100% empty strings (11/11 records) - **Critical field is unusable**
- `lessons.summary`: 36% empty strings - **Poor content quality**

**游리 Performance Issues:**
- Dead tuple ratios of 27-32% in active tables
- No data archiving strategy for user progress data
- Complex constraint checking may impact write performance

#### Positive Design Elements:
- Comprehensive constraint validation
- Proper ENUM types for status fields
- Good indexing on foreign key relationships
- Audit trail implementation

## Critical Flaws That Will Break the System

### 1. **Data Type Mismatches** 游댮
**Problem**: Incompatible ID types between related tables
- `lessons.id` (integer) vs `lesson_progress.lesson_id` (UUID expected)
- `progress.user_id` (varchar) vs `users.id` (UUID)

**Why it breaks**: Foreign key constraints cannot be established, leading to:
- Data integrity violations
- Application crashes on JOIN operations
- Inability to establish proper relationships

**Solution**: Standardize on UUID throughout or convert all to consistent integer types

### 2. **Empty Required Fields** 游댮
**Problem**: Core business fields contain only empty data
- `lessons.topic`: 100% empty (this should be impossible with NOT NULL constraint)
- Critical for content categorization and user experience

**Why it breaks**: 
- Search and filtering functionality will fail
- Recommendation engines cannot function
- User interface will show blank content

**Solution**: Data cleansing and application validation fixes required

### 3. **Missing Primary Keys** 游댮
**Problem**: `lessons_backup` table lacks primary key
**Why it breaks**:
- PostgreSQL streaming replication will fail
- Backup/restore operations may lose data
- Performance degrades significantly

### 4. **Constraint Violations** 游댮
**Problem**: NOT NULL constraints exist but data violates them
**Why it breaks**: Database is in inconsistent state, suggesting:
- Application bypassing ORM validations
- Direct database manipulation without proper checks
- Potential corruption during migrations

## Missing Critical Elements

### 1. **Data Governance**
- No table/column comments for documentation
- No versioning strategy for schema changes
- Missing data retention policies

### 2. **Security Implementation**
- No Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Plain text password storage validation insufficient
- Missing audit logging for sensitive operations
- No data masking for PII

### 3. **Scalability Preparation**
- No partitioning strategy for growing tables
- No read replica configuration
- Missing connection pooling considerations
- No archival strategy for historical data

### 4. **Operational Excellence**
- No monitoring views for data quality
- Missing stored procedures for common operations
- No automated maintenance jobs defined
- Inconsistent naming conventions across schemas

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Critical - Fix within 1 week):
1. **Fix ID type mismatches** - Choose UUID or integer consistently
2. **Add primary key to `lessons_backup`**
3. **Data cleansing for empty required fields**
4. **VACUUM all tables with high dead tuple ratios**

### Short-term (1-4 weeks):
1. **Establish proper foreign key constraints**
2. **Implement data validation at application level**
3. **Add comprehensive table documentation**
4. **Set up automated VACUUM scheduling**

### Medium-term (1-3 months):
1. **Implement Row Level Security**
2. **Design data archival strategy**
3. **Optimize indexing strategy based on query patterns**
4. **Implement proper backup/restore procedures**

### Long-term (3+ months):
1. **Schema normalization and cleanup**
2. **Migration to single consistent schema design**
3. **Implementation of data governance framework**
4. **Performance monitoring and optimization program**

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk 游댮
- **Data Corruption Potential**: Type mismatches and constraint violations
- **Application Failure**: Invalid relationships will cause runtime errors
- **Data Loss Risk**: Missing primary keys and backup table issues

### Medium Risk 游리
- **Performance Degradation**: Dead tuples and inefficient queries
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Complex schema with unused features
- **User Experience**: Empty required fields affecting functionality

### Low Risk 游릭
- **Security Exposure**: Current setup adequate for development
- **Scalability**: Sufficient for current data volumes
- **Compliance**: No apparent regulatory compliance issues

## Conclusion

The database schema reveals a system in transition with significant technical debt. While both applications have solid foundational designs, critical data integrity issues need immediate attention. The `practise_improve_pilot` schema particularly shows signs of rapid development without proper data governance, leading to inconsistent implementations that will cause production failures.

**Priority 1**: Fix data type mismatches and empty required fields
**Priority 2**: Implement proper constraints and relationships  
**Priority 3**: Establish operational excellence practices

The analysis suggests this is a development/staging environment given the data quality issues, but if this is truly production, immediate intervention is required to prevent data loss and application failures.
